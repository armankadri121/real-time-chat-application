# 💬 Real-time Chat Application

A **full-stack, real-time chat application** built with **Spring Boot** on the backend and modern web technologies on the frontend.  
It leverages **WebSockets** with the **STOMP protocol** over **SockJS** to enable **instant, bi-directional communication**, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.  

This project demonstrates how to build a **scalable and efficient chat service** using Spring Boot and WebSocket-based messaging.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Real-time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly without refreshing.  
- 🎨 **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and simple UI for an intuitive chat experience.  
- 🔌 **WebSocket Communication**: Uses STOMP over SockJS for reliable communication.  
- 📡 **Efficient Backend Message Handling**: Spring Boot backend routes and delivers messages.  
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Optimized with Bootstrap for all devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend (Server-Side)
- **Spring Boot** – Core backend application framework  
- **Spring WebSocket** – For managing WebSocket connections  
- **Spring Messaging (STOMP protocol)** – Handles messaging over WebSockets  
- **Thymeleaf** – Server-side HTML template rendering  

### Frontend (Client-Side)
- **Thymeleaf** – Renders HTML templates  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Real-time client-side logic  
- **SockJS** – WebSocket fallback for browsers without native support  
- **STOMP.js** – JavaScript STOMP client for protocol handling  
- **HTML5 / CSS3** – UI structure and styling  
- **Bootstrap** – Responsive, mobile-first layout  

### Development & Infrastructure
- **Maven / Gradle** – Dependency management & build tool  
- **IntelliJ IDEA** – IDE for development  
- **Git** – Version control
